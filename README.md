Background

I was recently reading about the Python Natural Language Processing package called Spacy. I've dabbled in NLP and text classification in the past, and seeing Spacy's implementation got me excited. I wanted to give this a whirl without waiting for a relevant project at work to come up. I'm sure I'll bump up into another NLP problem at work, but there's no predicting when that would hit my desk.

Off to Kaggle I went to find a suitable dataset to reacquiant myself with the world of NLP and text classification. I'm also expecting to do some EDA on the non-text features as well. Both to help me feature-engineer my classify, and also to satisfy my own wine curioisity.
